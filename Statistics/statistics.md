# Statistics

## Datatypes:
There are two types of data, Quantitative and Categorical.
* **Quantitative** data takes on numeric values that allow us to perform mathematical operations (like the number of dogs).We can think of quantitative data as being either continuous or discrete.

   * **Continuous data** can be split into smaller and smaller units, and still a smaller unit exists. An example of this is the age of the dog - we can measure the units of the age in years, months, days, hours, seconds, but there are still smaller units that could be associated with the age.

   * **Discrete data** only takes on countable values. The number of dogs we interact with is an example of a discrete data type.

* **Categorical** are used to label a group or set of items (like dog breeds - Collies, Labs, Poodles, etc.).We can divide categorical data further into two types: Ordinal and Nominal.

    * **Categorical Ordinal** data take on a ranked ordering (like a ranked interaction on a scale from Very Poor to Very Good with the dogs).

    * **Categorical Nominal** data do not have an order or ranking (like the breeds of the dog).

### Analyzing Quantitative Data
*  **Four Aspects for Quantitative Data**:
   There are four main aspects to analyzing Quantitative data.

   - Measures of `Center`
   - Measures of `Spread`
   - The `Shape` of the data.
   - `Outliers`
   
 * **Measures of Center**
There are three measures of center:

   - Mean
   - Median
   - Mode
   
   <br></br>
   > `MEAN` is the average of the values in the dataset.
   `MEDIAN` is the middle most value of the sorted dataset.
   `MODE` is the value with higher frequency in the dataset. If all the values in the dataset share the same frequency then there is no mode. On the other hand if two or more values have the highest frequency then there are many modes.
   
* **Analyzing Categorical Data:**
Analyzing categorical data has fewer parts to consider. Categorical data is analyzed usually be looking at the counts or proportion of individuals that fall into each group. For example if we were looking at the breeds of the dogs, we would care about how many dogs are of each breed, or what proportion of dogs are of each breed type.
