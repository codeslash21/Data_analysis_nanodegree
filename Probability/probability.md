# Probability:
Probability and Statistics are opposite fields but they are related to each other. 
* In proabilty we predict future events based on models and causes that we can assume.
* In statistics we analyse the data from past events to infer those models and causes could be.
* When finding the probabilities using a continuous distribution, the probability of obtaining an exact value is zero.
