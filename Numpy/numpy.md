# Numpy(Numerical Python):

## Array:
Its `1-D` data structure of numpy. Its almost similar to python `List`. Example:
```
L=[a,b,c,d]
```
Below is the similarities -
### Similarities:
* Each element can be accessed by index. E.g. `L[0]=a`.
* Access a range of elements. E.g. `L[1:3]=[b,c]`.
* Use loops, e.g. `for x in L:`.
### Differences:
* Each element should be of same type unlike python List. That means each element should be int or float or char and so on.
* There are some special methods like - `mean()`, `std()` and can be multi dimensional.

### Operations:
#### Vectorized operation:
* Addition: `[1,2,3] + [4,5,6] = [5,7,9]`
* Scalar multi: `[1,2,3] * 3 = [3,6,9]`
